todo
====

This is a simple project to manage todo lists and notes. This was created when I was learning codeigniter.
To run this application, what you have to do is: 

- create a database called : jrdash
- import the tables into above created db using the file  jrdash.sql included here
- edit the database.php file in  jrdash\application\config based on your configuration

If you want to see how i have written the code for this app, please have a look into the following folders in the attacment:
1) jrdash\application\controllers
2) jrdash\application\models
3) jrdash\application\views
4)  jrdash\public

This app allows you to create and delete todo list and notes. Its possible to mark the todos as completed and incompleted.
Notes can be updated as well.
